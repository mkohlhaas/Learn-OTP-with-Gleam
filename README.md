# Learn OTP w/Gleam

Gleam has a package for using the OTP framework, called `gleam_otp`. It also
has a package for more fundamental Erlang specific concepts, `gleam_erlang`.

Reading order:
1. concurrency_primitives
2. tasks
3. actors
4. supervisors

All the code in this project is runnable, just run `gleam run -m <module_name>`.

```shell
gleam run -m concurrency_primitives
gleam run -m tasks
gleam run -m actors
gleam run -m supervisors
```
